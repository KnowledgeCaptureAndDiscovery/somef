https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/,Allen Mao,"To build from a repository copy, you will also need Cython to build C sources from the project's .pyx files. See the project's requirements-dev.txt file for guidance."

https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Installing Python
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"If you are using Windows, we recommend installing the Anaconda distribution of Python 3. This distribution has the majority of dependencies that HyVR requires."
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,It is also a good idea to install the HyVR package into a virtual environment. Do this by opening a command prompt window and typing the following:
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,conda create --name hyvr_env
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,You need to then activate this environment:
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,conda activate hyvr_env
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Linux
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"Depending on your preferences you can either use the Anaconda/Miniconda distribution of python, or the version of your package manager. If you choose the former, follow the same steps as for Windows."
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"If you choose the latter, you probably already have Python 3 installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager (e.g. apt on Ubuntu/Debian)."
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,In any way we recommend using a virtual environment. Non-conda users can use virtualenvwrapper or pipenv.
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Installing HyVR
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"Once you have activated your virtual environment, you can install HyVR from PyPI using pip:"
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,pip install hyvr
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"The version on PyPI should always be up to date. If it's not, you can also install HyVR from github:"
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,git clone https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr.git
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,To install from source you need a C compiler.
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Installation from conda-forge will (hopefully) be coming soon.
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Python

https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,The following steps provide guidance on how to install gprMax:
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"Install Python, required Python packages, and get the gprMax source code from GitHub"
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Install a C compiler which supports OpenMP
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Build and install gprMax
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,You can watch screencasts that demonstrate the installation and update processes.
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"1. Install Python, required Python packages, and get gprMax source"
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"We recommend using Miniconda to install Python and the required Python packages for gprMax in a self-contained Python environment. Miniconda is a mini version of Anaconda which is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial use and redistribution). It includes more than 300 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, and data analysis."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Download and install Miniconda. Choose the Python 3.x version for your platform. We recommend choosing the installation options to: install Miniconda only for your user account; add Miniconda to your PATH environment variable; and to register Miniconda Python as your default Python. See the Quick Install page for help installing Miniconda.
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Open a Terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run the following commands:
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,$ conda update conda
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,$ conda install git
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,$ git clone https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax.git
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,$ cd gprMax
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,$ conda env create -f conda_env.yml
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"This will make sure conda is up-to-date, install Git, get the latest gprMax source code from GitHub, and create an environment for gprMax with all the necessary Python packages."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"If you prefer to install Python and the required Python packages manually, i.e. without using Anaconda/Miniconda, look in the conda_env.yml file for a list of the requirements."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,2. Install a C compiler which supports OpenMP
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"gcc should be already installed, so no action is required."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,macOS
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"Xcode (the IDE for macOS) comes with the LLVM (clang) compiler, but it does not currently support OpenMP, so you must install gcc. That said, it is still useful to have Xcode (with command line tools) installed. It can be downloaded from the App Store. Once Xcode is installed, download and install the Homebrew package manager and then to install gcc, run:"
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,$ brew install gcc
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Microsoft Windows
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools (currently you must use the 2015 version, not 2017). Use the custom installation option and deselect everything apart from the Windows SDK for your version of Windows."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"Alternatively if you are using Windows 10 and feeling adventurous you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux and then follow the Linux install instructions for gprMax. Note however that currently WSL does not aim to support GUI desktops or applications, e.g. Gnome, KDE, etc...."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,3. Build and install gprMax
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Once you have installed the aforementioned tools follow these steps to build and install gprMax:
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"Open a Terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows), navigate into the top-level gprMax directory, and if it is not already active, activate the gprMax conda environment conda activate gprMax. Run the following commands:"
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,(gprMax)$ python setup.py build
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,(gprMax)$ python setup.py install
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,You are now ready to proceed to running gprMax.
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"If you have problems with building gprMax on Microsoft Windows, you may need to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin to your path environment variable."

https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Please install Rasterio in a virtual environment so that its requirements don't tamper with your system's Python.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,SSL certs
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"The Linux wheels on PyPI are built on CentOS and libcurl expects certs to be in /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt. Ubuntu's certs, for example, are in a different location. You may need to use the CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variable to specify the location of SSL certs on your computer. On an Ubuntu system set the variable as shown below."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio has a C library dependency: GDAL >=1.11. GDAL itself depends on some other libraries provided by most major operating systems and also depends on the non standard GEOS and PROJ4 libraries. How to meet these requirement will be explained below.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio's Python dependencies are listed in its requirements.txt file.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Development also requires (see requirements-dev.txt) Cython and other packages.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Binary Distributions
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Use a binary distributions that directly or indirectly provide GDAL if possible.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio distributions are available from UbuntuGIS and Anaconda's conda-forge channel.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Manylinux1 wheels are available on PyPI.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,OS X
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"Binary distributions with GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ4 libraries included are available for OS X versions 10.7+ starting with Rasterio version 0.17. To install, run pip install rasterio. These binary wheels are preferred by newer versions of pip."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"If you don't want these wheels and want to install from a source distribution, run pip install rasterio --no-binary rasterio instead."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"The included GDAL library is fairly minimal, providing only the format drivers that ship with GDAL and are enabled by default. To get access to more formats, you must build from a source distribution (see below)."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Binary wheels for rasterio and GDAL are created by Christoph Gohlke and are available from his website.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"To install rasterio, simply download both binaries for your system (rasterio and GDAL) and run something like this from the downloads folder:"
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install -U pip
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install GDAL-2.0.2-cp27-none-win32.whl
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install rasterio-0.34.0-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,You can also install rasterio with conda using Anaconda's conda-forge channel.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ conda install -c conda-forge rasterio
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Source Distributions
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Rasterio is a Python C extension and to build you'll need a working compiler (XCode on OS X etc). You'll also need Numpy preinstalled; the Numpy headers are required to run the rasterio setup script. Numpy has to be installed (via the indicated requirements file) before rasterio can be installed. See rasterio's Travis configuration for more guidance.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,The following commands are adapted from Rasterio's Travis-CI configuration.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ sudo apt-get update
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install rasterio
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Adapt them as necessary for your Linux system.
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"For a Homebrew based Python environment, do the following."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ brew update
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ brew install gdal
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ pip install --no-use-wheel rasterio
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"Alternatively, you can install GDAL binaries from kyngchaos. You will then need to add the installed location /Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs to your system path."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,"When building from source on Windows, it is important to know that setup.py cannot rely on gdal-config, which is only present on UNIX systems, to discover the locations of header files and libraries that rasterio needs to compile its C extensions. On Windows, these paths need to be provided by the user. You will need to find the include files and the library files for gdal and use setup.py as follows."
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ python setup.py build_ext -I<path to gdal include files> -lgdal_i -L<path to gdal library>
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,$ python setup.py install
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,We have had success compiling code using the same version of Microsoft's Visual Studio used to compile the targeted version of Python (more info on versions used here.).
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio,Allen Mao,Note: The GDAL dll (gdal111.dll) and gdal-data directory need to be in your Windows PATH otherwise rasterio will fail to work.
https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-mapnik,Allen Mao,npm install tilelive-mapnik
https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-mapnik,Allen Mao,Though tilelive is not a dependency of tilelive-mapnik you will want to install it to actually make use of tilelive-mapnik through a reasonable API.

https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,curl -fsSL https://get.nextflow.io | bash
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,It creates the nextflow executable file in the current directory. You may want to move it to a folder accessible from your $PATH.
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,Download from Conda
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,Nextflow can also be installed from Bioconda
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,conda install -c bioconda nextflow
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,make compile
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,"The very first time you run it, it will automatically download all the libraries required by the build process."

https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,Known compilation problems
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,Nextflow required JDK 8 to be compiled. The Java compiler used by the build process can be choose by setting the
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,JAVA_HOME environment variable accordingly.
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,"If the compilation stops reporting the error: java.lang.VerifyError: Bad &lt;init&gt; method call from inside of a branch,"
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,this is due to a bug affecting the following Java JDK:
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,1.8.0 update 11
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,1.8.0 update 20
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,Upgrade to a newer JDK to avoid to this issue. Alternatively a possible workaround is to define the following variable
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,in your environment:
https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow,Rosna Thomas,_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Xverify:none'

We don’t recommend this approach for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on npm."
https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux,Rosna Thomas,React Native
https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux,Rosna Thomas,"As of React Native 0.18, React Redux 5.x should work with React Native. If you have any issues with React Redux 5.x on React Native, run npm ls react and make sure you don’t have a duplicate React installation in your node_modules. We recommend that you use npm@3.x which is better at avoiding these kinds of issues."

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,Basics
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"Opening a file for reading is done with the segyio.open function, and idiomatically used with context managers. Using the with statement, files are properly closed even in the case of exceptions. By default, files are opened read-only."

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"Files can be opened in unstructured mode, either by passing segyio.open the optional arguments strict=False, in which case not establishing structure (inline numbers, crossline numbers etc.) is not an error, and ignore_geometry=True, in which case segyio won't even try to set these internal attributes."

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,f.offsets Inferred offsets numbers

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"If the file is opened unstructured, all the line properties will will be None."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,Modes
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"In segyio, data is retrieved and written through so-called modes. Modes are abstract arrays, or addressing schemes, and change what names and indices mean. All modes are properties on the file handle object, support the len function, and reads and writes are done through f.mode[]. Writes are done with assignment. Modes support array slicing inspired by numpy. The following modes are available:"
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,trace
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"The trace mode offers raw addressing of traces as they are laid out in the file. This, along with header, is the only mode available for unstructured files. Traces are enumerated 0..len(f.trace)."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"Reading a trace yields a numpy ndarray, and reading multiple traces yields a generator of ndarrays. Generator semantics are used and the same object is reused, so if you want to cache or address trace data later, you must explicitly copy."

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,>>> f.trace[-2]
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,>>> f.trace[15:45]

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,header
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"With addressing behaviour similar to trace, accessing items yield header objects instead of numpy ndarrays. Headers are dict-like objects, where keys are integers, seismic unix-style keys (in segyio.su module) and segyio enums (segyio.TraceField)."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"Header values can be updated by assigning a dict-like to it, and keys not present on the right-hand-side of the assignment are unmodified."

https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,">>> f.header[5][25, 37] # read multiple values at once"
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"iline, xline"
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"These modes will raise an error if the file is unstructured. They consider arguments to [] as the keys of the respective lines. Line numbers are always increasing, but can have arbitrary, uneven spacing. The valid names can be found in the ilines and xlines properties."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"As with traces, getting one line yields an ndarray, and a slice of lines yields a generator of ndarrays. When using slices with a step, some intermediate items might be skipped if it is not matched by the step, i.e. doing f.line[1:10:3] on a file with lines [1,2,3,4,5] is equivalent of looking up 1, 4, 7, and finding [1,4]."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"When working with a 4D pre-stack file, the first offset is implicitly read. To access a different or a range of offsets, use comma separated indices or ranges, as such: f.iline[120, 4]."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"fast, slow"
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"These are aliases for iline and xline, determined by how the traces are laid out. For inline sorted files, fast would yield iline."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,depth_slice
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"The depth slice is a horizontal, file-wide cut at a depth. The yielded values are ndarrays and generators-of-arrays."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,gather
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"The gather is the intersection of an inline and crossline, a vertical column of the survey, and unless a single offset is specified returns an offset x samples ndarray. In the presence of ranges, it returns a generator of such ndarrays."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,text
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"The text mode is an array of the textual headers, where text[0] is the standard-mandated textual header, and 1..n are the optional extended headers."
https://github.com/equinor/segyio,Allen Mao,"The text headers are returned as 3200-byte string-like blobs (bytes in Python 3, str in Python 2), as it is in the file. The segyio.tools.wrap function can create a line-oriented version of this string."

https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,function HelloMessage({ name }) {
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,}
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,ReactDOM.render(
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,"<HelloMessage name=""Taylor"" />,"
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,document.getElementById('container')
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,);
https://github.com/facebook/react,Allen Mao,"This example will render ""Hello Taylor"" into a container on the page."
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,Running the container without any arguments will by default output the GDAL version string as well as the supported raster and vector formats:
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,docker run geodata/gdal
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,The following command will open a bash shell in an Ubuntu based environment with GDAL available:
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,docker run -t -i geodata/gdal /bin/bash
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,"You will most likely want to work with data on the host system from within the docker container, in which case run the container with the -v option. Assuming you have a raster called test.tif in your current working directory on your host system, running the following command should invoke gdalinfo on test.tif:"
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,docker run -v $(pwd):/data geodata/gdal gdalinfo test.tif
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,"This works because the current working directory is set to /data in the container, and you have mapped the current working directory on your host to /data."
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,"Note that the image tagged latest, GDAL represents the latest code at the time the image was built. If you want to include the most up-to-date commits then you need to build the docker image yourself locally along these lines:"
https://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker,Allen Mao,docker build -t geodata/gdal:local git://github.com/geo-data/gdal-docker/
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Running gprMax
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"gprMax is designed as a Python package, i.e. a namespace which can contain multiple packages and modules, much like a directory."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"Open a Terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows), navigate into the top-level gprMax directory, and if it is not already active, activate the gprMax conda environment conda activate gprMax."
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Basic usage of gprMax is:
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,(gprMax)$ python -m gprMax path_to/name_of_input_file
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,For example to run one of the test models:
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,(gprMax)$ python -m gprMax user_models/cylinder_Ascan_2D.in
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,When the simulation is complete you can plot the A-scan using:
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,(gprMax)$ python -m tools.plot_Ascan user_models/cylinder_Ascan_2D.out
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,Your results should like those from the A-scan from the metal cylinder example in introductory/basic 2D models section
https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax,Allen Mao,"When you are finished using gprMax, the conda environment can be deactivated using conda deactivate."

https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,"The above command will cause readgssi to save and show a plot named ""DZT__001_100MHz.png"" with a y-size of 6 inches at 150 dpi (-p 6) and the autostacking algorithm will stack the x-axis to some multiple of times shorter than the original data array for optimal viewing on a monitor, approximately 2.5*y (-s auto). The plot will be rendered in the viridis color scheme, which is the default for matplotlib. The -m flag will draw a histogram for each data channel. Example 1a Example 1a histogram"
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,example 1B
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1b.png -p 5 -s auto -c viridis -g 50 -m -r -w
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,"This will cause readgssi to create a plot from the same file, but matplotlib will save the plot as ""1b.png"" (-o 1b.png). The script will plot the y-axis size (-p 5) and automatically stack the x-axis to (-s auto). The script will plot the data with a gain value of 50 (-g 50), which will increase the plot contrast by a factor of 50. Next readgssi will run the background removal (-r) and dewow (-w) filters. Finally, the -m flag will draw a histogram for each data channel. Note how the histogram changes when filters are applied. Example 1b Example 1b histogram"
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,example 1C: gain can be tricky depending on your colormap
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,readgssi -i DZT__001.DZT -o 1c.png -p 5 -s auto -r -w -c seismic
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,"Here, background removal and dewow filters are applied, but no gain adjustments are made (equivalent to -g 1). The script uses matplotlib's ""seismic"" colormap (-c seismic) which is specifically designed for this type of waterfall array plotting. Even without gain, you will often be able to easily see very slight signal perturbations. It is not colorblind-friendly for either of the two most common types of human colorblindness, however, which is why it is not the default colormap. Example 1c"
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,example 2A: no background removal
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2a.png -p 10 -s 3 -n
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,"Here readgssi will create a plot of size 10 and stack 3x (-p 10 -s 3). Matplotlib will use the default ""Greys"" colormap and save a PNG of the figure, but the script will suppress the matplotlib window (-n, useful for processing an entire directory full of DZTs at once). Example 2a"
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,example 2B: horizontal mean BGR algorithm applied
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,readgssi -i DZT__002.DZT -o 2b.png -p 10 -s 3 -n -r
https://github.com/iannesbitt/readgssi,Allen Mao,"The script does the same thing, except it applies horizontal mean background removal -r. Note the difference in ringing artifacts between examples 2a and 2b."

https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResNeXt,Rosna Thomas,Note: CIFAR datasets will be automatically downloaded and processed for the first time. Note that in the arXiv paper CIFAR results are based on pre-activated bottleneck blocks and a batch size of 256. We found that better CIFAR test acurracy can be achieved using original bottleneck blocks and a batch size of 128.

https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,"There's a file named ""input.txt"". You can add as many profiles as you want in the following format with each link on a new line:"
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,https://www.facebook.com/andrew.ng.96
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,https://www.facebook.com/zuck
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,Make sure the link only contains the username or id number at the end and not any other stuff. Make sure its in the format mentioned above.
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,Note: There are two modes to download Friends Profile Pics and the user's Photos: Large Size and Small Size. You can change the following variables. By default they are set to Small Sized Pics because its really quick while Large Size Mode takes time depending on the number of pictures to download
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,whether to download the full image or its thumbnail (small size)
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,if small size is True then it will be very quick else if its False then it will open each photo to download it
https://github.com/harismuneer/Ultimate-Facebook-Scraper,Rosna Thomas,and it will take much more time

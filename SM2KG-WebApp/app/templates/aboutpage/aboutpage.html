  <hr class = "my-4">
    <p>With an increase of complex scientific software, researchers need to spend a large portion of their time searching for avaliable software documentation and source code, and reading it to understand the software used and the proper way to cite it. SoMEF is designed to help highlight the most significant aspects of the scientific documentation by processing README files in GitHub repositories. It automatically extracts the contents of the README file into 4 categories: description, installation, invocation, or a citation of a software component.</p>

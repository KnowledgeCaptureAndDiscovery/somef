        ## Documentation
        See full documentation at [https://somef.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://somef.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 3.6
        
        Note: SOMEF has not been tested on Python 3.8.
        
        ## Install from GitHub
        To run SOMEF, please follow the next steps:
        
        Clone this GitHub repository
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef.git
        ```
        
        Install somef (note that you should be in the folder that you just cloned)
        
        ```
        cd somef
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        Test SOMEF installation
        
        ```bash
        somef --help
        ```
        
        If everything goes fine, you should see:
        
        ```bash
        Usage: somef [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
        Options:
          -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
        
        Commands:
          configure  Configure credentials
          describe   Running the Command Line Interface
          version    Show somef version.
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage 
        
        ### Configure
        Before running SOMEF, you must configure it appropriately. Run
        
        ```bash
        somef configure
        ```
        
        And you will be asked to provide the following: 
        
        - A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour. For more information, see [https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) 
        - The path to the trained classifiers (pickle files). If you have your own classifiers, you can provide them here. Otherwise, you can leave it blank
        
        ### Run SOMEF
        
        ```bash
        $ somef describe --help
          SOMEF Command Line Interface
        Usage: somef describe [OPTIONS]
        
          Running the Command Line Interface
        
        Options:
          -t, --threshold FLOAT           Threshold to classify the text  [required]
          Input: [mutually_exclusive, required]
            -r, --repo_url URL            Github Repository URL
            -d, --doc_src PATH            Path to the README file source
            -i, --in_file PATH            A file of newline separated links to GitHub
                                          repositories
        
          Output: [required_any]
            -o, --output PATH             Path to the output file. If supplied, the
                                          output will be in JSON
        
            -g, --graph_out PATH          Path to the output Knowledge Graph file. If
                                          supplied, the output will be a Knowledge
                                          Graph, in the format given in the --format
                                          option
        
          -f, --graph_format [turtle|json-ld]
                                          If the --graph_out option is given, this is
                                          the format that the graph will be stored in
        
          -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
        ```
        
        ## Usage example:
        The following command extracts all metadata available from [https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/). 
        
        ```bash
        somef describe -r https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco/ -o test.json -t 0.8
        ```
        
        ### Add/Remove a Category:
        
        If the user wants to run the classifier for an additional category or wants to remove an existing category, corresponding path entry in the config.json should be provided and the category type should be added/removed in the category variable in cli.py

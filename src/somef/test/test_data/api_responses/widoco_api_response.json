Only if a config file is provided, the properties won't be loaded. There is still a flag, which I have preferred to leave for possible legacy issues.\r\n* Markup is now recognized in all sections\r\n* The diagram is now optional (by default it was always produced in older versions)\r\n* This release also includes a doc folder with guidelines on the metadata properties to use, a benchmark of ontologies used for testing, a gallery with what WIDOCO can accomplish and a summary of projects that have adopted WIDOCO.\r\n\r\nBug fixes: \r\n* Changed the pom file with another plugin for creating the JAR, because some of the RIO parsers  were not creating the appropriate serializations of the ontology.\r\n* Added robustness when the changelog was created. If a wrong URI is provided, then the changelog will not be created.\r\n* Changed how the ontology is chosen so there won't be errors in MAC systems.\r\n* Fixed some of the language tags.\r\n* Polished some errors related to the interface.",

Before, an empty section would remain.\r\n* Fixed table of contents not being translated.\r\n* When generating the documentation of an ontology, if it imports another ontology that cannot be imported for any reason, Widoco will ignore the import instead of failing.\r\n* Added the possibility to ignore namedIndividuals when generating the documentation through console.\r\n\r\n",

For all classes, properties and data properties, Widoco will calculate the new changes, additions and deletions and present them in a human-readable manner. In order to benefit from this feature, you just have to annotate your ontology with the URI of the previous version. You can use owl:priorVersion, dc:replaces or prov:wasRevisionOf to annotate your ontology (Widoco will only consider one file to compare against).\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements:\r\n* RDF-a annotations are replaced with JSON-LD snippets. The page is just annotated with schema.org. The rdf-a annotations made it difficult to maintain, and the structured extraction tool provided by Google did not work. With the JSON-LD snippet everything is clearer. The provenance of the page itself is published separately.\r\n* Now it is possible to generate ONLY the cross reference section of an ontology.\r\n* Bug fix that led to errors when opening some ontologies like OBI\r\n\r\nOverview sample of the changelog:\r\n![overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1520666/23640611/ac4407f6-02a3-11e7-8a88-b597ba740721.png)\r\n",

Note that if the language is not supported, the system will load the labels in english. For example: en-pt-es\n\n`-licensius`: Use the Licensius web services (http://licensius.com/apidoc/index.html) to retrieve license metadata. Only works if the -getOntologyMetadata  flag is enabled.\n\n`-noPlaceHolderText`: Do not add any placeholder text (this will remove intro, abstract (if empty) and description sections).\n\n`-ontFile PATH`  [required (unless -ontURI is used)]: Load a local ontology file (from PATH) to document. This option is incompatible with -ontURI\n\n`-outFolder folderName`: Specifies the name of the folder where to save the documentation. By default is 'myDocumentation'\n\n`-ontURI  URI`   [required (unless -ontFile is used)]: Load an ontology to document from its URI. This option is incompatible with -ontFile\n\n`-oops`: Create an html page with the evaluation from the OOPS service (http://oops.linkeddata.es/)\n\n`-rewriteAll`: Replace any existing files when documenting an ontology (e.g., from a previous execution)\n\n`-rewriteBase PATH`: Change the default rewrite base path. The default value is \"/\". This flag can only be used with the htaccess option.\n\n`-saveConfig PATH`: Save a configuration file on PATH with the properties of a given ontology\n\n`-uniteSections`: Write all HTML sections into a single HTML document.\n\n`-useCustomStyle`: Export the documentation using alternate css files (by Daniel Vila).\n\n`--version`: Shows the current version of WIDOCO.\n\n`-webVowl`: Create a visualization based on WebVowl (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/index.html#) in the documentation.\n\n",

                "value": "WIDOCO separates the contents of different sections in HTML files, which are then loaded in the `index.html` file. WIDOCO was designed this way because it's easier to edit your introduction or description sections independently without being all aggregated together in a huge HTML document.  **When all the contents generated by WIDOCO are stored in a server, you will be able to see the documentation of your ontology using any browser**. However, if you open the `index.html` file **on your local browser**, you may see a document missing most of the sections in your documentation. This happens because browsers don't allow loading separate content when opening a file locally for security reasons. If you want to explore how your ontology would look locally, you have two options:\n\n* a) Execute WIDOCO with the `-uniteSections` flag; or select the option `add al sections in a single document` in the \"load sections\" step in the WIDOCO GUI. This will make all the sections of WIDOCO to be in the `index.html`; and you will be able to see it in your browser. Note that the **LODE visualization will not be available** when exploring your ontology locally.\n* b) Create a local server: Set up a local server (e.g., using XAMPP or Tomcat) and serve the files WIDOCO generates (in the `htdocs` folder for Apache servers).\n\nIf you place the files generated by WIDOCO in a server and access them via its URL (for example, a Github page), you should be able to see your documentation appropriately.\n",
